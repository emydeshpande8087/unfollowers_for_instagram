# unfollowers_for_instagram
This Script will give a CSV report which mentions the usernames of the accounts which you follow on instagram but they dont follow you back.
This is similar to the Unfolowers app on playstore.

Insert your user name and password at the top of the script. Instagram will send you a verification code on your email or SMS on mobile. Insert the code on the terminal
and wait.
